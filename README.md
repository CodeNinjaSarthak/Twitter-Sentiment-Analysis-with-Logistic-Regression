## Project Overview
Sentiment analysis is a process of determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a given piece of text. This project focuses on classifying tweets as positive or negative using Logistic Regression as the classification model. The tweets are preprocessed using text-cleaning techniques such as stemming, and then transformed into numerical representations using TF-IDF vectorization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Numpy** for numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation
- **NLTK** for text preprocessing (Stemming, Stopword removal)
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Logistic Regression** for classification

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of Twitter data with labels indicating whether the tweet expresses a positive or negative sentiment:
- **0**: Negative sentiment
- **1**: Positive sentiment

## Model and Evaluation
The project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify tweets into positive and negative sentiments. The following steps are performed:
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Includes stemming, stopword removal, and cleaning.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression is used to train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix are used to evaluate the model.

### Key Evaluation Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 77.86%
- **Precision**: 76.82%
- **Recall**: 79.80%
- **F1-Score**: 78.29%

## Setup and Installation
